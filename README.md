# RNDPFileEditor

Edits preset files generated by the [Universal Pok√©mon Randomizer](https://github.com/Dabomstew/universal-pokemon-randomizer) so that the user can specify their own seed. This is useful for races so that all participants can submit a partial seed and so that the host cannot have access to the randomized ROM beforehand, in the interest of fair play.

## Example of usage

The race host asks some or all participants to submit a number of digits. The host then concatenates the digits to make the seed. The host configures the settings for the race in the randomizer and generates a dummy ROM so that the application creates the race RNDP file. The host edits the RNDP file to change the randomly-generated seed to the one that the participants collaborated on. The host distributes the new RNDP file with the new seed to all race participants so that they can generate their race ROM. If the host is also participating in the race, they must make sure that they throw away the dummy ROM and generate a new one with the RNDP file they distributed.
